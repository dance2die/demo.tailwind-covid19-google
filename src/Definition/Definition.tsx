        Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new
        virus.
      </DefinitionParagraph>
      <DefinitionParagraph>
        The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with symptoms such
        as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. You
        can protect yourself by washing your hands frequently, avoiding touching
        your face, and avoiding close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people
        who are unwell.

      <DefinitionParagraph>How it spreads</DefinitionParagraph>
      <DefinitionParagraph>
        Coronavirus disease spreads primarily through contact with an infected
        person when they cough or sneeze. It also spreads when a person touches
        a surface or object that has the virus on it, then touches their eyes,
        nose, or mouth.

      <DefinitionParagraph>
        People may be sick with the virus for 1 to 14 days before developing
        symptoms. The most common symptoms of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are
        fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Most people (about 80%) recover from
        the disease without needing special treatment.
      </DefinitionParagraph>
      <DefinitionParagraph>
        More rarely, the disease can be serious and even fatal. Older people,
        and people with other medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, or
        heart disease), may be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill.
